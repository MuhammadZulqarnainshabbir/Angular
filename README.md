### Q: What are Directives in Angular
   - Directives are classes that add additional behaviors to the element in our angular application, we can use built-in Angular Directives to manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see.

### What is the difference between Template Driven and Reactive Forms
   - Template Driven Forms rely on HTML templates to handle the form state and validation using angular directives. It's easier to set up and less complex but it becomes less manageable for complex forms.
